# Landing Page v1 Plan (Placeholder)

This file will be populated after reviewing the landing page chat session.

Expected modules to validate against backend:
- CMS public content (`/cms/public`)
- Public pages (`/cms/pages/:slug`)
- Banners and announcements
- Home sections rendering
- SEO and analytics tags

Do not implement until the landing page chat is analyzed.
